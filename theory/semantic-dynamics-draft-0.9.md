# Semantic Dynamics – Draft 0.9

## 1. Core Claim
Semantic Dynamics (SD) is a theory of how **tension** drives **semantic motion**, and how repeated motion **crystallizes** into reusable **cognitive artifacts**. Tension is the driver; crystallization is the outcome; artifacts reshape future tension landscapes.

A compact loop:
```
Tension → Semantic Motion → 
Distillation/Stabilization → 
Crystallization (Artifact) → 
(Artifact reshapes future Tension)
```


### Nature of the Theory (Scope)

SD is intentionally implementation-free. It provides a vocabulary to describe cognitive motion but makes no normative claims about what a subject should conclude. Crucially, Crystallization does not guarantee truth; it only indicates the formation of a reusable structure. SD requires no specific tooling, protocol, or runtime.


#### Usage Note
SD is descriptive (orientation + vocabulary), not prescriptive (no mandated procedure).
Use phases and mismatch classes as templates, not a pipeline; SD focuses on usable artifacts rather than final truth-claims.


#### Overview (Informative)

```text
Core loop (template):
  [Tension] -> [Semantic Motion] -> [Distill/Stabilize] -> [Crystallize] -> [Artifact]
      ^                                                           |
      |                                                           v
      +-------------------- (artifacts reshape future tension) ----+

Phase vocabulary (template, not pipeline):
  Emergence -> Divergence -> Resonance -> Distillation -> Stabilization -> Crystallization -> Rest
      ^                                                                       |
      +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

```text
Mismatch classes (core) as "where the loop fails to balance":

  M1 Motion Excess:           [Motion]  >>>  [Compression]     (overload / runaway)
  M2 Premature Closure:       [Closure] too early / too narrow (lock-in)
  M3 Oscillatory Non-conv.:   [Framing A] <-> [Framing B]      (no settling)
  M4 Suppressed Flow:         [Tension] --x--> [Emergence]     (blocked surfacing)
```

The phase sequence and mismatch classes shown above define the standard taxonomy used in this document.



## 2. Two Axioms

### Axiom 1 — Tension drives semantic motion
Where there is sustained **Tension**, semantic material tends to remain in motion:
- new meaning emerges into language,
- existing meaning splits into alternatives,
- meaning re-appears across time until reorganized or quieted.

"Tension" here is not "emotion" as such; it is the felt **unresolved pull / conflict / fog / overload** that keeps cognition from settling into a stable lens.

### Axiom 2 — Crystallization creates reusable artifacts
Repeated semantic motion, when compressed and stabilized, yields **Crystallization**:
- a structure becomes internally reusable (a default lens for thinking/acting),
- and often externally expressible (a name, diagram, principle, narrative, framework).

A crystallized structure is a **cognitive artifact**.  

A self-model is one important class of such artifacts — a crystallized structure that allows a cognitive system to predict and regulate its own behavior. It functions as a stable lens through which the self interprets interaction.


## 3. Minimal Vocabulary

- **Mind-pop**: an atomic semantic event worth noticing (a thought/inner sentence/meaning-burst that insists on reappearing).
- **Tension**: the unresolved pull that sustains motion.
- **Semantic Motion**: the family of transformations that occur while tension remains active.
- **Distillation**: compression of noisy material into fewer clearer semantic objects.
- **Stabilization**: damping of oscillations; a structure becomes a workable lens.
- **Crystallization**: stabilization that becomes reliably reusable (and often shareable).
- **Rest**: a low-motion state that supports integration and prevents overload.

(Threads, branches, resonance/CR, and other extended constructs are useful but non-core; see Appendices.)


## 4. Modes of Semantic Motion
Under tension, semantic material typically undergoes a small set of operator-like transformations:

- **Emergence**: something becomes explicit that was previously implicit.
- **Divergence**: multiple competing continuations appear (alternate framings / hypotheses / action paths).
- **Resonance**: one framing "rings true" and begins to attract reuse and re-organization.
- **Distillation**: many fragments compress into named patterns, principles, or candidate lenses.
- **Stabilization**: the candidate lens stops being fragile; new material mostly fits rather than overturns.
- **Crystallization**: the lens becomes a reusable cognitive artifact.


## 5. Mechanisms

From Axiom 1:
- mind-pops persist not primarily because of weak will or bad memory,
- but because the underlying tension remains active,
- and the system has not yet produced (or trusted) an artifact that sufficiently reorganizes that tension.

From Axiom 2:
- mind-pops quiet down when an artifact forms that can reliably "hold" the tension:
  naming it, compressing it, and providing a stable way to think/act through it.


## 6. Crystallization

A structure counts as crystallized when it is:
- **Internally reusable**: the person can reliably re-enter the lens and use it to think/act.
- **Semantically compressive**: it reduces repeated mind-pop churn by carrying meaning in a compact form.
- **Resilient**: minor new evidence refines rather than collapses it.

Optional but common:
- **Externally expressible**: it can be written, diagrammed, taught, or shared.

Crystallization also provides **anchors** for future reflection.


## 7. Mismatch Classes (Imbalances) as Tension × Artifact mismatch

Most "failure modes" in reflection can be described as mismatches between:
- the rate/shape of tension-driven motion, and
- the system's ability to distill, stabilize, crystallize, and rest.

### The Four Core Mismatch Classes
- **M1 — Motion Excess**: motion generation rate > compression capacity.
- **M2 — Premature Closure**: a stable lens forms too early or too narrowly; alternatives are suppressed.
- **M3 — Oscillatory Non-convergence**: competing framings alternate without settling.
- **M4 — Suppressed Flow**: tension exists but emergence is inhibited; little usable material surfaces.


## 8. Rebalancing directions (descriptive)
Rebalancing concerns the relationship between semantic motion and artifact formation.  
Typical rebalancing tendencies include:

- **Emergence/Divergence throttling** (when overloaded or runaway): scope narrowing; branching reduction; novelty injection reduction.
- **Distillation strengthening** (when scattered or oscillating): summarization; pattern naming; representative selection.
- **Frame-check / Meta-reflection** (when locked-in or premature): alternative framing tests; cross-context checks.
- **Rest protection** (when intensity is high): pausing; cooling; gentle review of crystallized forms.

SD does not prescribe techniques; it provides language for describing what is out of balance and how it tends to re-balance.

# Appendices (Notes / Expanded Material)

## Appendix A — Extended construct set (non-core but commonly useful)
- **Thread**: a time-extended trajectory of related mind-pops revisited across episodes.
- **Branch**: a structural split into distinct continuations around the same tension core.
- **Resonance / Cognitive Resonance (CR)**: a high-energy alignment state where small prompts trigger large internal reorganization; powerful but risk-amplifying (overload / lock-in).
- **Stabilization vs Rigidity**: stabilization is damping; rigidity is stabilization that refuses revision under evidence.


## Appendix B — Analytical Heuristics

To apply SD to an observed cognitive process, consider the following observation questions:

- **Locate Tension**: What is the current unresolved pull (fog/conflict/overload)?
- **Rate Check**: Is semantic motion (emergence/divergence) exceeding the capacity to distill (M1)?
- **Artifact Check**: Is there a candidate artifact (name/pattern/lens)? Is it resilient or brittle?
- **Rest Check**: Is rest missing, or is emergence suppressed (M4)?
- **Sufficiency Criteria**: What constitutes "enough crystallization" for the current context?

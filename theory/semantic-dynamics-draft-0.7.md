# Semantic Dynamics – Draft 0.7

## 1. Core Claim
Semantic Dynamics (SD) is a theory of how **tension** drives **semantic motion**, and how repeated motion **crystallizes** into reusable **cognitive artifacts** (including Self Model structures).  
Tension is the driver; crystallization is the outcome; artifacts reshape future tension landscapes.

A compact loop:
Tension → Semantic Motion → Distillation/Stabilization → Crystallization (Artifact) → (Artifact reshapes future Tension)

#### Usage Note
SD is descriptive (orientation + vocabulary), not prescriptive (procedure + diagnosis).
Use phases/regimes as templates, not a pipeline; aim for usable artifacts, not final truth.

## 2. Two Axioms

### Axiom 1 — Tension drives semantic motion
Where there is sustained **Tension**, semantic material tends to remain in motion:
- new meaning emerges into language,
- existing meaning splits into alternatives,
- meaning re-appears across time until reorganized or quieted.

"Tension" here is not "emotion" as such; it is the felt **unresolved pull / conflict / fog / overload** that keeps cognition from settling into a stable lens.

### Axiom 2 — Crystallization creates reusable artifacts
Repeated semantic motion, when compressed and stabilized, yields **Crystallization**:
- a structure becomes internally reusable (a default lens for thinking/acting),
- and often externally expressible (a name, diagram, principle, narrative, framework).

A crystallized structure is a **cognitive artifact**.  
A "Self Model" is one important class of such artifacts (named tensions, recurring patterns, self-principles, narrative lenses, etc.).

## 3. Minimal Vocabulary (Core Layer)

- **Mind-pop**: an atomic semantic event worth tracking (a thought/inner sentence/meaning-burst that insists on reappearing).
- **Tension**: the unresolved pull that sustains motion.
- **Semantic Motion**: the family of transformations that occur while tension remains active.
- **Distillation**: compression of noisy material into fewer clearer semantic objects.
- **Stabilization**: damping of oscillations; a structure becomes a workable lens.
- **Crystallization**: stabilization that becomes reliably reusable (and often shareable).
- **Rest**: a low-motion regime that supports integration and prevents overload.

(Threads, branches, resonance/CR, and regime taxonomies are useful but non-core; see Appendices.)

## 4. The Motion Operators (What "Semantic Motion" means)
Under tension, semantic material typically undergoes a small set of operator-like transformations:

- **Emergence**: something becomes explicit that was previously implicit.
- **Divergence**: multiple competing continuations appear (alternate framings / hypotheses / action paths).
- **Resonance**: one framing "rings true" and begins to attract reuse and re-organization.
- **Distillation**: many fragments compress into named patterns, principles, or candidate lenses.
- **Stabilization**: the candidate lens stops being fragile; new material mostly fits rather than overturns.
- **Crystallization**: the lens becomes a reusable cognitive artifact.

These are not a strict pipeline. They are a descriptive vocabulary for "what kind of work the system is doing right now."

## 5. Why mind-pops persist (Core explanatory payoff)
From Axiom 1:
- mind-pops persist not primarily because of weak will or bad memory,
- but because the underlying tension remains active,
- and the system has not yet produced (or trusted) an artifact that sufficiently reorganizes that tension.

From Axiom 2:
- mind-pops quiet down when an artifact forms that can reliably "hold" the tension:
  naming it, compressing it, and providing a stable way to think/act through it.

## 6. Artifacts and Crystallization (What "counts")
A structure counts as crystallized when it is:
- **Internally reusable**: the person can reliably re-enter the lens and use it to think/act.
- **Semantically compressive**: it reduces repeated mind-pop churn by carrying meaning in a compact form.
- **Resilient**: minor new evidence refines rather than collapses it.

Optional but common:
- **Externally expressible**: it can be written, diagrammed, taught, or shared.

Crystallization also provides **anchors** for future reflection.


## 7. Regimes (Imbalances) as Tension × Artifact mismatch
Most "failure modes" in reflection can be described as mismatches between:
- the rate/shape of tension-driven motion, and
- the system's ability to distill, stabilize, crystallize, and rest.

### The Four Core Mismatch Classes
- **M1 — Motion Excess**: motion generation rate > compression capacity.
- **M2 — Premature Closure**: a stable lens forms too early or too narrowly; alternatives are suppressed.
- **M3 — Oscillatory Non-convergence**: competing framings alternate without settling.
- **M4 — Suppressed Flow**: tension exists but emergence is inhibited; little usable material surfaces.


## 8. Recovery moves (minimal, descriptive)
Recovery is rebalancing motion and artifact formation:

- **Throttle Emergence/Divergence** (when overloaded or runaway): narrow scope; budget branches; reduce question generation.
- **Enforce Distillation** (when scattered or oscillating): summarize; name patterns; select representative examples.
- **Frame-check / Meta-reflect** (when locked-in or premature): test alternative framings; cross-context validation.
- **Protect Rest** (when intensity is high): pause; allow cooling; gentle review of crystallized forms.

SD does not prescribe techniques; it provides language for describing what needs rebalancing.

## 9. Non-goals
SD is intentionally implementation-free:
- no required tooling, protocol, or runtime,
- no normative claims about what one "should" conclude,
- no guarantee that crystallization equals truth—only that it yields reusable structure.

# Appendices (Notes / Expanded Material)

## Appendix A — Extended construct set (non-core but commonly useful)
- **Thread**: a time-extended trajectory of related mind-pops revisited across episodes.
- **Branch**: a structural split into distinct continuations around the same tension core.
- **Resonance / Cognitive Resonance (CR)**: a high-energy alignment state where small prompts trigger large internal reorganization; powerful but risk-amplifying (overload / lock-in).
- **Stabilization vs Rigidity**: stabilization is damping; rigidity is stabilization that refuses revision under evidence.

## Appendix B — Mapping from Draft 0.5 sections to Core v0.6
Kept in Core (compressed):
- Purpose & scope; perspective (as non-goals + core claim)
- Tension, Distillation, Crystallization, Overload/Rest, and "cycle as template"

Moved to Appendix (summarized):
- Detailed definitions/examples of mind-pop, branching, threads
- Full cycle elaboration (Emergence/Divergence/Resonance/CR details)
- Full regime catalog and recovery strategies
- Future work and measurement ideas

## Appendix C — Practical diagnostic prompts (optional)
To locate "what's happening" in a session:
- What is the current tension (pull/fog/conflict/overload)?
- Are we generating motion (emergence/divergence) faster than we can distill?
- Do we have a candidate artifact (name/pattern/lens)? Is it resilient or brittle?
- Is rest missing (or is emergence suppressed)?
- What would count as "enough crystallization for now" (a usable lens, not final truth)?

## Appendix D — Regime Alias Mapping (Draft 0.6 → Core v0.7)
